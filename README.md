# DS-2002-Snyder-Capstone

This Capstone Project Performs ETL Processes in converting an OLTP database into an OLAP data warehouse. The sample database here is a small dataset of bank transactions made across different branches with employee and account data. The Capstone notebook contains all important code for this process. It starts using code from the _utility-methods and 3.0-Lab-setup notebooks and it is based upon the database constructed by the three .sql scripts.
